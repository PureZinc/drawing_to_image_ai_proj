# Building Neural Networks

I'm building my own Neural Network to gain an understanding of how they work.
I understand that there are already libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow, I'm just curious about how they work and how to use them.

This project allows you to make your own image-detection AI. THis will help in understanding AI and how it works.
